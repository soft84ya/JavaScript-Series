GIT Knowledge

1. Create the branch

2. Switch to the branch

dono task ek he baar krne h to . -b  means create new brach jump to new branch

git checkout -b <new-branch>

master -> new branch 

git init
git brach
git checkout -b 15Mar24

 document.

 . = member selection operator

Airthematic operator 
 + = addition
 - = subscription

 * , / all are airthematic operator


 object.member  Formula
 document.getElementById()

    = Assigment operator

    Left = Right
    Left <- Right    
    
    = means value kidther se assign ho rhe h right to left

    example : document.getElementById('root').innerHTML="thats Great";

'' = single Qoute
"" = Double Qoute 

    if value in Qoute 'abc' thats means string value.


    variable are like bucket

    var <variable name>
    var x;
    var y;
    var var;

    variables are stored in Memory (RAM)

    Prescedence of operator (means priority)

    z = x+y; //Expression 
    
    tell me how many operator u can see?
     2 operator = +  
     
      jab b kisi line me ek se jyada operator aaye to wo expression 
     khe jyge .
     if u understand in Maths so it is a eqation but in JS its a Expression.


 kisi expression ko js solve krte h that means Prescedence (priority) kisi document

 + having higher priority (Prescedence)
 = have low priority

 x and y are operands

 operands + operands


Associativity of operator  Left = Right
                Left <- Right

        z = x+y  this is a expression. expression me priority jo bata h usko Prescedence kehthe hai.
                  z ke ander jo value aayge wo kon btyga Associativity btata hai 

                  exmaple  pehle addition hua uske baad result aaya . result z me jyga wo Associativity btyaga.                  


1) Prescedence of operator
2) Associativity of operator
  dono chezo se milke expression solve hota hai.

        //object.member
        console.log(z);

        //const a; const ka ek rule h jha usko declare kr rhe ho whahe usko initialize krna padega evn wo syntax error dega.

        a = 50; // declare and initilazation.
        console.log(z+a);
